## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

1. Centering the entire card component

```css
.section__card-component {
    display: flex;
    justify-content: center;
    align-items: center;
    height: 100vh;
}
```
- display: flex; turns the ```<section>``` into a flex container.
- ```justify-content: center;``` moves the child element (the ```<ul>```) to the horizontal center.
- ```align-items: center;``` moves it to the vertical center.
- ```height: 100vh;``` ensures the section fills the full viewport height, so the centering works properly.

ðŸ‘‰ This makes the whole 3-card component sit perfectly in the middle of the screen.

2. Arranging the cards side by side

```css
.card-component__items {
    display: flex;
    flex-direction: row;
    list-style: none;
    width: 57.5rem;
    border-radius: 10px;
    overflow: hidden;
}
```
- ```display: flex;``` makes the ```<ul>``` a flex container.
- By default, ```flex-direction: row;``` arranges its children (```<li>``` cards) in a horizontal row.
- Each ```<li>``` becomes a flex item, so they sit next to each other.

ðŸ‘‰ This is why the Sedans, SUVs, and Luxury cards appear in a single row instead of stacking vertically.

3. Responsive adjustment
```css
@media (max-width: 37.5rem) {
    .card-component__items {
        flex-direction: column;
        width: 20.5rem;
    }

    .section__card-component {
        height: 100%;
        margin: 5.5rem 0;
    }
}
```
- On small screens, ```flex-direction: column;``` stacks the cards vertically.
- The width is reduced, so they look like a neat column instead of being squished.
- On desktop, the section was set to ```height: 100vh;``` so it always fills the entire viewport height and centers the cards vertically, but it's not the case in the mobile version (it breaks the whole design). On mobile, using ```height: 100%``` instead makes the sectionâ€™s height shrink to fit its content (the stacked cards).

ðŸ‘‰ This makes the layout responsive â€” adapting to both desktop (row) and mobile (column).

4. To create space inside each card between the content (```img, h2, p, button```) and the cardâ€™s border/background I used padding on the ```<li>``` elements:

```css
.card-component__items li {
    padding: 3rem;
}
```
- Every ```<li>``` inside ```.card-component__items``` gets ```3rem``` of padding on all four sides (top, right, bottom, left).
- The text and button do not touch the edges â€” giving the design breathing room and better readability.

ðŸ‘‰ So, this is basically internal spacing for each card.
